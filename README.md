# Deep Learning in Pytorch

the superior python NN framework


## Directory for Directory
- "data" : torch `datasets` style data + other general (not experiment specific) data
- "experiments" : specific experiments (each could basically be its own repo) to learn something
- "implementations" : implemented architectures/code, aimed to be importable and used in several places
- "models" : saved model weights, see `notebooks/sample_saving.ipynb` for info on saving the weights (pickled weights taste great to me but not in different environments or to others)
- "notebooks" : interactive python notebooks with information
- "utils" : misc code that can be shared but is not a specific architecture or deep learning module/method
